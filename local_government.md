I was sent [an article](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/05/29-local-government-strategic-trends-desouza/desouza.pdf) predicting substantial problems for local government in the next two decades based on a smorgasbord of favorite current-futurist topics.


UAVs ("drones"): the article correctly identifies that regulation is lagging the technology, then proceeds to make a questionable leap. "If ultimately approved for commercial use, these UAVs would effectively
eliminate the need for conventional package delivery services."  Flight is intrinsically an energy-inefficient means of transport.  It's conceivable that UAVs will be used for last-10-meters delivery (though even there, the merits seem dubious), but traditional package delivery methods (roughly, put boxes into a truck) are much more efficient for non-trivial distances.  I wouldn't be surprised by a roboticized delivery truck, though shifting the human labor to the recipient (a la Amazon Locker) seems simpler.

Automated vehicles ("self-driving cars"): the points about the loss of tax revenue are interesting, though I ultimately don't find them compelling without a discussion of the cost to acquire those revenues.  It seems improbable that employing fine-collecting law enforcement is actually revenue positive for local governments, as if it were one would expect saturation.

Artificial intelligence: claims of "resulting riots,
citizen outcry, and crime would surge as displaced workers struggle to meet their basic needs" are needlessly dystopian, and in a rather charming way.  It presupposes a nightmarish hellscape in which mass numbers of people raise a ruckus, and that this is not summarily squashed.  The first way to prevent this from occurring is simply to provide people their basic needs, which should be easier (not harder) in a markedly more productive society.  The second way is to simply deny them their relevance while they starve to death or are summarily executed.  I'd advocate for door #1.

Moving past that, while it is likely true that if our current tax structures (roughly, high income tax, low corporate rates) persisted that the percentage of output captured as taxes would decrease, there's no guarantee that that will remain the tax structure. 

P2P: Lumping Netflix in with P2P is dubious at best - it may be democratizing, but it certainly isn't a "sharing economy".

Bitcoin has failed to achieve significant adoption and I don't believe the prospects are good, for both human (the community squabbles fiercely, network effect issues) and technological reasons (it's intrinsically inefficient).

The less controversial "sharing economy" companies cited (Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit) are currently legislative challenges, but I'm extremely skeptical that they will prove long-term untaxable.  If nothing else, the supplementary income can be, and already is in many cases.

Data privacy: yes, this is an area where the legislation lags reality. 

Fragile and conflict states: "In the future, criminals and terrorists will harness even more advanced technologies from the life sciences to, for
instance, attack cities".  The only "advanced technology" necessary to kill the record number of citizens in a terror attack is a liter of cultured botulinum, technology that has existed for well in excess of a century.  

The world is becoming markedly less violent (Pinker's "The Better Angels of our Nature"), the contrary belief is counterfactual fear-mongering.

Moreover, I would argue that these issues definitionally transcend the scope of local government.

Income inequality: addressing the causes is largely beyond the powers of local goverment, mitigating the effects (eg, low-income assistance) is not.

Immigration: this will be a "lumpy" local government issue - many will simply not be affected, others have been, many will be. I don't think it's a revelation.
