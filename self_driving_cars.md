My brother and I spent several hours arguing about the future of self-driving cars.

The core of our difference of opinion is probably my general pessimism, but there were also a few legitimate points of departure.

As of this writing, self-driving cars are an obviously "hot" technology, with a few players potentially viable to capture the market with a network-dispatched self-driving fleet.

Apple, Google, Tesla and Uber are all candidates, with the various auto manufacturers as also-rans.

I don't believe that Apple has the capability to deliver a truly autonomous vehicle in the near future for myriad reasons:
* Their traditional product secrecy is antithetical to road-testing (barring elaborate camouflage)
* It's a fairly hard data/engineering problem and Apple is primarily a fashion company
* It's unclear that a self-driving car can be a luxury good within the auto space, Apple strives to be Veblen

Google is my top choice for delivering on an autonomous fleet
* Google has made the most (public) progress on a truly self-driving car
* The wealth of transit data (from Maps, Waze, etc.) positions Google extraordinarily well to roll out a fleet
* Deep pockets

My primary concern with Google is that they may lack focus on a particular self-driving initiative (eg, the network-dispatched fleet) and instead make ultimately unsuccesful attempts in multiple segments.  The most likely failure-case there seems to be rolling out individually-owned cars in addition to the fleet to the detriment of both.

Tesla is my second choice for delivering the fleet
* Tesla is the only contender that has substantial relevant manufacturing experience
* Tesla has limited self-driving capabilities as of this writing

Unfortunately, Tesla doesn't have an obvious story for transitioning to network-dispatch: they don't have a mobile OS or (widely-adopted) application.  Tesla is also currently positioned as a luxury, network-dispatch is non-luxury.

Uber is a phenomenal company, but
* Uber has no public progress on self-driving cars to date
* Uber's most significant competitive advantage is the dual-sided network of drivers and passengers. The driver network is (largely) irrelevant for a truly self-driving fleet.

The auto manufacturers (including Tesla) and (to a lesser extent) Uber would cannibalize their core business by rolling out a self-driving fleet.

The end state of a network-dispatched self-driving fleet is probably somewhere between a remarkably efficient bus system and the currently extant Uber. 

Bus systems already attempt to map demand, but
* they make unneccessary stops (due to schedule / ambiguity around whether or not people waiting at a stop actually intend to ride the bus)
* their route is purely prescribed
* they lack elastic capacity

It likely will never make economic sense to dispatch a self-driving car to retrieve an individual from a remote location. For some categories of remote location (eg, the wilderness) it's unclear that self-driving cars will even function acceptably.

I predict a consumer-ready self-driving car by 2020, with limited availability (likely confined to a single state or handful of states in the US) and no significant (> 10%) disruption of existing driving-based businesses (eg, trucking) until after 2020.

If a network-dispatched self-driving fleet comes to pass (I hope it does), I do not believe Uber will be the majority operator thereof as of 2025.  A majority of cars in the US will still be human-driven as of 2025.
