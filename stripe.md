Disclosure: I currently work for Braintree (/ PayPal) and therefore am likely biased.

Stripe's most recent round (from Visa) was at a $5B valuation.  

Stripe's volume is currently undisclosed, but reported as "billions".

For lack of a better baseline, I'll use Braintree's valuation at time of acquisition - $12B in volume, $800M to acquire.  That works out to $0.066_ (repetant) valuation / $1 volume.

Rounding up for easier math, using $0.07 of valuation / $1 in transaction volume, implies $71,428,571,400 in  transaction volume. 

The entire US ecommerce market in 2014 was about $305B.  

Amazon's net sales in North America in 2014 were approximately $55.47B.

My brother conjectured that Stripe would have a greater market-cap than PayPal at some point in the near future.  As of this writing, PayPal's market cap is approximately $45B.

Which suggests that Stripe will need to have ~2.25x Braintree's margin and the entirety of 2014 US ecommerce.  

Visa's market share in 2014 was [46.2%](http://www.cardhub.com/edu/market-share-by-credit-card-network/).  

Stripe will not achieve a $45B (2015 dollars) valuation by 2030.
