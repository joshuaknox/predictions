Disclosure: I currently work for Braintree (/ PayPal) and therefore am likely biased.

Stripe's most recent round (from Visa) was at a $5B valuation.  

Stripe's volume is currently undisclosed, but reported as "billions".

For lack of a better baseline, I'll use Braintree's valuation at time of acquisition - $12B in volume, $800M to acquire.  That works out to $0.066_ (repetant) valuation / $1 volume.

Rounding up for easier math, using $0.07 of valuation / $1 in transaction volume, implies $71,428,571,400 in  transaction volume. 

The entire US ecommerce market in 2014 was about $305B.  

Amazon's net sales in North America in 2014 were approximately $55.47B.

My brother conjectured that Stripe would have a greater market-cap than PayPal at some point in the near future.  As of this writing, PayPal's market cap is approximately $45B.

Which suggests that Stripe will need to have ~2.25x Braintree's margin and the entirety of 2014 US ecommerce.  

Visa's market share in 2014 was [46.2%](http://www.cardhub.com/edu/market-share-by-credit-card-network/).  

Stripe will not achieve a $45B (2015 dollars) valuation* by 2030.

*In the event of multiple valuations, the final one is to be used, with the order of precedence as: (public) market cap, acquisition price, private equity.  As a concrete example, were Stripe to receive a venture valuation of $60B in 2028 and IPO at a $40B market cap at the end of 2030, I will only consider the market cap for proving/disproving this prediction (it is both later and higher precedence).  It's unlikely that the precedence will matter due to the "use the last" heuristic, but it's conceivable that two or more events would occur proximately.  Similarly, a down venture round overrules a previous higher venture valuation.
